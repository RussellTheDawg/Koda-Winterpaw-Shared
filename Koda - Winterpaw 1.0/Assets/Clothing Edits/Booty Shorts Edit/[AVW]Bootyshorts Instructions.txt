[AVW]Bootyshorts Instructions:

Simply click and drag onto your avatars hierarchy and you're good to go!

Some things to note:
-If you activate the object in the scene to see it, make sure you deactivate it as you found it! Otherwise it wont toggle properly in game. 
-If you need to resize your collider due to using a bigger blendshape, you're looking for the "String.root" bone in Armature. Small adjustments in Radius and Height would be all you need. 
-You may have to adjust your strings! For those, you're wanting the POSITION of the X,Y,Z coordinates in play mode for StringA_01 and StringB_01. Reapply coordinates in scene more and you're set!
