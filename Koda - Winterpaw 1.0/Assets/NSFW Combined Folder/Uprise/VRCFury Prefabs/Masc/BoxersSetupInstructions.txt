To get the boxers to function properly, you'll need to unpack the 'boxers.MascCanine' prefab to edit the
VRCFury script. If you look at the VRCFury components on the boxers prefab, you'll notice in the toggle,
there are two empty slots in the 'Turn Off' state. You'll want to put 'Penis' and 'Particles' in those
slots. This enables you to toggle on the penis asset to use the arousal recievers and hide the penis
mesh when the boxers are toggled on. Toggling the boxers off will return the penis and particles to
their original state. It also makes the transition between clothed and nude seamless, even when you're
not currently in arousal mode!
