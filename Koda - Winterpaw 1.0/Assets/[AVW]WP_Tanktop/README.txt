Shirt Features

PC - 4 sets of PBR (Standard) Materials 

Quest - 3 sets of preset STL (Compressed) Materials 

Sets include: 2 x Flannel, 2 x Latex, 6 x Meshnet (exclusive to PC, Quest does not support alpha in the time of publishing) and Navy

Full blendshape support to customize your avatars shape however you see fit**

Tucked in and untucked versions

Setup

All you need prior to import is VRCfury, similar or better results may be able to be achieved with Poiyomi but not required for initial setup.

Drag and drop prefab into your avatar hierarchy  and it -should- immediately work out of the  box. 

IF IT DOESNT

Click and drag initial prefab into avatar hierarchy 

In inspector click the far 3 dot option, Copy Component

Click and drag Supplied FBX into the avatar hierarchy, paste Component Values (you may need to click and drag each portion once more, better safe than sorry and drag "Hips" from armature to "Hips" in Root bone/object. Then click and drag the bottom most (Tank_Under from hierarchy, as an example) to fill each remaining object/link/toggle

Done!

Note:

I have tried to be as accommodating as I can with the blendshapes, but when being combined with multiple 90~100% ranges there may be very minor clipping. Saying that, it is very far and few between and I aim to remedy them as soon as I'm made aware to the best of my ability in future updates. Very difficult to see every combination with the vast customization that the canine has!

Terms of Service

You MAY 

Modify this item however you like! Fit it to your avatars that aren't necessarily designed to fit, etc! If you're that savvy with it by all means tag me on twitter, I'd like to see!

Provide a retexturing service! Make it worth your while, by all means sell the materials only in the marketplace or commission basis 

You MAY NOT

Redistribute. These assets take a lot of time to make and you explicitly may not provide them in your own packages to resell, redistribute or rebrand in any way. I'm not against working with you if we can both benefit from it. 

Final Notes:

If you have any questions, comments or concerns messaging me on Twitter is the best way of contact, as well as staying up to date with new products. Any problems with fitment or general quality I'd absolutely appreciate in hearing. It'll help everyone as I release updates. 

If you end up enjoying the shirt and feeling overgenerous, I have a ko-fi! Every bit helps!
